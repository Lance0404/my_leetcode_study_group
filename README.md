### How should we run the event?
* Each presenter should provide the leetcode link to the host before the event, so the host can announce it beforehand.
* Each presenter should finish the leetcode task and have a solution before the event.
* Search and provide better solution with links is suggested.
* The host will provide a zoom link for everyone to join, and presenters should share their screen in order.
* Each presenter can spend at most 5 min describing the leetcode task, and at most 5 min describing his solution, without interuption.
* At most 10 min for questions. 
* Time should be controlled wisely for both presenter and asker.
* Futher discussion can be carried out offline.
